# tutor
Offshoot of old archived python_tutorial repository/github pages, wider topic set
will contain python tutorial content but will cover more topics
mainly as a resource to consolidate my own knowledge and have a resource i can direct my friends to that is better than the alternatives, might be hard to achieve against official python docs and math resources but might end up being useful for computer science topics
