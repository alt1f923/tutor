                            <p>Now this is all well and good, but what if you want to use the result of your expression for later?</p>
                            <p>You can assign it to a variable like so: <code>x = 3 + 2</code>, this will create an <code>int</code> called <code>x</code> that is equal to <code>5</code>. You could then use <code>x</code> later on, or change it like so:</p>
                            <span>
<pre>>>>x = 3 + 2
>>>x
5
>>>x = x - 2 # 5 - 2
>>>x
3
>>>x *= 2 # 3 * 2
>>>x
6</pre>
                            </span>
                            <p>As you may have noticed, I did <code>x *= 2</code>. This is shorthand for <code>x = x * 2</code>. It will do the same thing and you can use this format for any operator.</p>

                            <p>You can use any letter or an underscore as the first character of a variable name, and for any character after that can be any letter, number or an underscore.</p>
                            <p>Now before you go and start naming variables willy-nilly. There are commonly accepted conventions for how you should name things, as I introduce new concepts I'll say what their naming convention is, but as for what we have covered so far by <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Variable names should be completely lowercase with words separated by an underscore</li>
                                <li>Globals (Variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the code and can be changed) should follow the same convention as variables</li>
                                <li>Constants (Variables that you can access for later, and which shouldn't be changed e.g. <code>PI = 3.14</code>) should be completely uppercase with words separated by an underscore</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I wouldn't worry too much about globals or constants, as you probably won't be needing to use them for a while.</p>
                            <p><b>If you use a linter one of the things that it will check is if you follow naming conventions.</b></p>
