                            <p>Python may be different to languages that you have used before or will use in the future. Python is an interpreted high level language. What that means is, Python will talk to your computer by converting the code you've written into instructions that it can understand one instruction at a time.</p>
                            <p>That's what an interpreter does, a compiler on the other hand will convert the entire program to instructions that the computer can understand in one go. They both have their advantages, but generally compilers are faster than interpreters, but I wouldn't worry about that, Python is relevant and widely appreciated by programmers worldwide despite that.</p>
                            <p>Continuing the explanation, to be high level as a programming language, the language is far less complex and thus easier for humans to understand, sacrificing performance and control in return for an easier programming experience.</p>
                            <p>Because the logic behind programs is generally the same despite this, you still have to think the same way when programming in a lower level language like Rust or C++ as you do when you program in Python, but an advantage of it is you can implement your creative ideas quickly and easily.</p>

                            <p>Here's a good video that explains the concept well, better than I ever could, even if it is a little dated:</p>

                            <p>One of the advantages of Python being an interpreted language is that you can write code and get instant feedback. A way to do this is by using the Python shell, to open it you can open the default Python IDLE, or type "py" into cmd or powershell. (If this doesn't work try "Python" or "Python3", if you can't get it to work at all, make sure Python is in your PATH)</p>
                            <p>A good way to get an understanding of how the interpreter works is to use the shell, think of every line in your code as another line typed out into the shell. One by one.</p>
                            <p>For the first few topics, I will be using the Python in "interactive mode", which is just a fancy way to say that I'll be using the Python shell to demonstrate them.</p>
            
                            <p>When you open the shell via the terminal, it should look something like this (I'm on windows).</p>

                            <p>Exiting the python shell (with <code>exit()</code>) you can run <code>py --version</code> to check your version of Python. (Even though it tells you in the top line of the shell)</p>
