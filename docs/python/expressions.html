                            <p>The first concept I would like to introduce to you is <b>Expressions</b>. You should be familiar with these if you've done any form of mathematics in your life, you might not be familiar with the terminology surrounding them and that's okay. That's not what is important here, the skills are.</p>
                            <p>Here is an example of an Expression.</p>
                            <code>(52 + 7 * 4) - 11</code>
                            <p>You probably know exactly what an expression is now, just by looking at that, but indulge me for a moment, expressions are built up of <b>operands</b> and <b>operators</b>. Operands in this example being 52, 7, 4 and 11. The operators in this case are +, * and -. What it equals isn't really important, but if you figure it out, good for you.</p>

                            <p>Operands can be anything that can represent a value, so if you have x that equals a number then that would be a valid operand.</p>
                            <p>Operators are the symbols that denote what operation should be done to it's accompanying operands. There are few of them, the ones I want to show you are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>+</code> for addition</li>
                                <li><code>-</code> for subtraction</li>
                                <li><code>*</code> for multiplication</li>
                                <li><code>/</code> for division</li>
                                <li><code>//</code> for integer/floor division (rounding down to the closest lowest whole number)</li>
                                <li><code>**</code> for exponentiation</li>
                                <li><code>%</code> for modular arithmetic (also known as: modulus/modulo/mod)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You might have noticed that the first 4 are pretty simple, and they are. Good job for picking up on that.</p>

                            <p>Here are some examples of these operations in use, feel free to play around with the Python shell by writing some expressions yourself!</p>
