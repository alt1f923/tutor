                    <h1>A resource for all of us</h1>
                    <p>As an ex-university student I've been taught a lot of things, forgotten a majority of them too. Normally this wouldn't be too bad, but occasionally I'd like to know these things for a project or to teach it to a friend. So I decided to create a resource where I could do both, and hopefully help anyone else along the way.</p>
